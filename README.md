# Database Management System

## Overview

This project is a Database Management System (DBMS) implemented in Java, designed to interact with users through a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to create, manipulate, and manage databases and tables, execute queries, and export databases. This project is based on a prior C++ implementation.

## Features

- **User Interaction via GUI**: The application uses JavaFX for its graphical user interface, enabling user interaction through keyboard and mouse.
- **Database Creation and Loading**: Users can create a new database or load an existing one. The application supports loading databases from custom formats and SQL files.
- **Table Manipulation**: Users can create, delete, and view tables within the database.
- **Query Execution**: The application can execute SQL queries and display the results.
- **Database Export**: Users can export the database to a specified format and location.
- **Session Management**: The application allows users to save their work and confirm before exiting without saving.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- JavaFX SDK
